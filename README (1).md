# Speech-to-Text for Transcription Services

This project focuses on developing a robust transcription system using state-of-the-art speech-to-text models. It includes preprocessing of raw audio data, normalization, visualization, and preparation for transcription using models like OpenAI Whisper or Hugging Face Transformers.

## Features

- Audio cleaning (silence trimming, normalization)
- Spectrogram and waveform visualization
- Ready for integration with Whisper or Hugging Face models
- Accent analysis and quality inspection via audio features

## Setup

Install the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install kaggle transformers torchaudio librosa noisereduce openai-whisper datasets
```

## Usage

1. Upload your audio file in `.wav` format.
2. Run the preprocessing cells to clean and normalize audio.
3. Visualize audio via waveform and spectrogram.
4. Extend with transcription and classification as needed.

## File Structure

- `project_1_Speech_to_Text_for_transcription_services.ipynb`: Main notebook
- Audio files should be in `.wav` format

## Future Work

- Integrate Whisper model for real transcription
- Support for batch processing and large datasets
- Accent classification and misclassification detection
